### Mobile Device Security Policy

**Document Owner:** Sarah Mitchell (Office Admin)  
**Approved By:** James Harrison (Director)  
**Approved Date:** 15th January 2025  
**Review Date:** 15th January 2026  
**Version:** 1.0

---

### 1. Purpose

This policy defines security requirements for mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) used to access NorthWest Heating & Gas Ltd business systems, customer data, or communications.

---

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All company-owned mobile devices (currently 6 Samsung Galaxy A34 phones)
- Personal mobile devices used to access work email, Tradify, or customer data
- All employees, contractors, and subcontractors

**Current devices:**
- 6 company Samsung phones (engineers)
- 2 personal iPhones used for email (James and Sarah)
- 1 company iPad for quotes (Sarah)

---

### 3. Device Security Requirements

All mobile devices accessing company data must have:

#### 3.1 Access Controls
- Screen lock enabled with PIN, password, fingerprint, or face recognition
- Automatic lock after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Minimum 6-digit PIN (we're not doing complex passwords on phones - fingerprint is fine)

#### 3.2 Encryption
- Full device encryption enabled
- **Note:** All our Samsung phones (Android 12+) and iPhones have this by default - you don't need to do anything

#### 3.3 Software Updates
- Operating system must be updated within 30 days of security updates being released
- **How we do this:** Sarah checks all company phones on the first Monday of each month
- Work apps (Tradify, Outlook, Teams) must be kept updated - turn on auto-update in app stores

#### 3.4 Malware Protection
- Only install apps from official app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store)
- **Absolutely no "cracked" or sideloaded apps**
- Don't click suspicious links in text messages

**What this means in practice:** If you wouldn't download it on your personal phone, don't download it on the work phone.

---

### 4. Company-Provided Devices (Our 6 Samsung Phones + iPad)

#### 4.1 Acceptable Use
Company phones are for work but reasonable personal use is fine:

**Allowed:**
- Personal calls/texts during lunch/breaks
- Personal photos (but keep work photos organized in Tradify)
- Music/podcasts while driving between jobs
- Maps/navigation apps
- WhatsApp for personal use

**Not allowed:**
- Gambling apps
- Adult content
- Anything illegal
- Installing random apps without thinking about security
- Excessive personal use during work hours (use common sense)

**James's note:** We're not monitoring what you do on work phones. Just don't take the piss and don't do anything that could get us in trouble.

#### 4.2 Device Management
The company (James and Sarah) can:
- Remotely locate phones if reported lost
- Remotely wipe phones if lost and not recovered
- Check data usage if phone bill seems unusually high

**We will NOT:**
- Read your texts or personal emails
- Look at your photos
- Track your location (unless you've reported it lost)
- Monitor what websites you visit

#### 4.3 Lost or Stolen Company Phones

**If you lose your work phone or it's stolen:**

1. **Call James or Sarah immediately** - doesn't matter what time it is
   - James mobile: 07XXX XXXXXX
   - Sarah mobile: 07XXX XXXXXX
   - If neither answer, text both and call the office: 0161 XXX XXXX

2. **We'll remotely lock the phone** using Find My Device

3. **If not found within 24 hours,** we'll remotely wipe it

4. **You'll get a replacement phone** - there's always spares in the office

5. **File a police report** if it was stolen (needed for insurance)

**What happens:** Nothing bad happens to you if you lose the phone. Just report it immediately so we can protect customer data.

**Real example from 2024:** Tom left his phone on a job site. Realized 2 hours later. Called James. We locked it remotely. Customer found it and called the office. Tom picked it up the next day. No drama.

---

### 5. Personal Devices (BYOD - Bring Your Own Device)

**Currently:** Only James and Sarah use personal phones for work email.

#### 5.1 Your Choice
You can choose to:
- Use your personal phone for work (if it meets security requirements), OR
- Ask for a company phone instead - we'll provide one

**No one is required to use their personal phone for work.**

#### 5.2 Security Requirements for Personal Phones Used for Work
If you choose to use your personal phone:
- Must have screen lock (PIN/fingerprint)
- Must keep it updated
- Must have Find My iPhone/Find My Device enabled
- Must install and use password manager

#### 5.3 What We Manage vs. What's Private
If you use your personal phone:
- **Work stuff we manage:** Outlook app, Tradify app, work email
- **Personal stuff that's private:** Everything else - your photos, texts, personal apps, etc.

If you lose your phone, we'll only wipe the work apps, not your personal photos/data.

#### 5.4 If You Want to Stop Using Personal Phone
Tell Sarah with 1 week notice. We'll move your data to a company phone. Easy.

### 6. Specific Rules - Don't Do These Things

❌ Don't let your family use your work phone to access customer data  
❌ Don't save customer details in your personal contacts app (keep them in Tradify)  
❌ Don't use dodgy public WiFi for accessing Xero or banking (phone data is fine)  
❌ Don't screenshot customer details and text them to yourself  
❌ Don't disable your screen lock because "it's annoying" - it's 2 seconds of your time  

---

### 7. Where Customer Data Should Live

**Use these systems (they're backed up and secure):**
- Email: Microsoft Outlook
- Jobs and customer details: Tradify
- Files: OneDrive
- Accounts: Xero

**DON'T store customer data in:**
- WhatsApp messages (use the phone number, not WhatsApp, for work calls)
- Your personal photo album
- Notes apps on your phone
- Text messages

**For photos of jobs:**
- Take the photo
- Upload to Tradify immediately
- Delete from your phone camera roll after uploading

**Real situation we fixed:** One of the lads had 400+ job site photos in his camera roll going back 18 months. If he'd lost that phone, that's 400 customer homes exposed. Now we upload to Tradify and delete from phones within 24 hours.

---

### 8. Apps You Need to Have

**Required apps on work phones:**
- Microsoft Outlook (email)
- Tradify (job management)
- Bitwarden (password manager - Sarah will set you up)
- Microsoft Teams (we barely use it but have it installed anyway)

**Recommended but optional:**
- WhatsApp (for personal use)
- Google Maps / Waze
- Spotify / podcast apps for driving

**Get approval before installing:**
- Any app that wants access to your contacts
- Any app that wants access to your camera/photos when it doesn't need it
- Any app from a developer you've never heard of

**If in doubt, ask Sarah.**

---

### 9. Keep Your Phone Safe

**At customer sites:**
- Don't leave your phone on the customer's kitchen counter and wander off
- Don't leave it in the van unlocked
- Lock it when you put it down

**In the van:**
- Don't leave it on the dashboard in plain sight when parked
- We've had windows smashed before - don't make it easy for thieves

**At home:**
- It's your phone, do what you want
- But remember there's customer data on it

---

### 10. When You Leave the Company

**If you leave NorthWest Heating:**
- Give back the company phone on your last day (charged and in working order)
- We'll wipe it before giving it to the next person
- If you were using your personal phone, Sarah will remove the work apps

**You keep:**
- Your personal contacts (we never had access)
- Your personal photos
- Your personal apps

**We keep:**
- Customer data (it stays in Tradify/email)
- Work-related photos (should already be in Tradify)

---

### 11. What Happens If You Break the Rules

**First time / minor stuff:**
- We'll have a chat
- Remind you why the rule exists
- No drama

**Serious or repeated violations:**
- Formal warning
- Could lead to disciplinary action

**Really serious (like intentionally exposing customer data):**
- Dismissal
- Potential legal consequences under GDPR

**But honestly:** Just use common sense. These rules aren't difficult. We're not trying to catch you out.

---

### 12. Questions or Problems?

**Ask:**
- Sarah for day-to-day phone issues: sarah@northwestheating.co.uk
- James for policy questions: james@northwestheating.co.uk

**Phone support:**
- Office: 0161 XXX XXXX
- Sarah mobile: 07XXX XXXXXX
- James mobile: 07XXX XXXXXX

**If you think you've messed up:** Tell us immediately. We'd rather fix it than discover it months later.

---

### 13. Policy Review

We'll review this policy:
- Every January (annual review)
- If we have a security incident involving phones
- If we change phone providers or apps
- If the rules aren't working in practice

**Current status:** v1.0 - this is our first proper mobile device policy. We'll learn as we go.

## 📊 Implementation Notes

### How NorthWest Heating Implemented This

**Week 1: Planning**
- James and Sarah went through the template together
- Discussed what was realistic for their team
- Decided to keep it simple and practical

**Week 2: Technical Setup**
- Sarah spent Monday afternoon setting up Find My Device on all 6 company phones
- Checked all phones had screen locks (2 didn't - fixed immediately)
- Updated all phones to latest Android version
- Installed Bitwarden on all phones

**Week 3: Team Rollout**
- Friday afternoon team meeting (15 minutes)
- James explained why they're doing this ("Customer asked about security, we want Cyber Essentials, need to protect customer data")
- Walked through the main points using plain English
- Answered questions (mostly "Does this mean you're tracking us?" - No.)
- Everyone acknowledged they understood

**Week 4: Follow-up**
- Sarah checked all phones had PINs set up properly
- Helped one engineer who was struggling with Bitwarden
- No major issues

### What They Changed From the Template

**Added:**
- Specific phone models they use
- Named contacts (James and Sarah with actual numbers)
- Real example of what happened when Tom lost his phone
- More casual, direct language ("use common sense" instead of formal policy-speak)

**Removed:**
- Lots of the formal legal language
- Excessive detail about encryption (it's automatic on their phones)
- Complex procedures they wouldn't actually follow

**Why it worked:**
- Short enough people actually read it
- Used real names and situations
- Felt like it came from James, not a lawyer
- Focused on "this is what we actually do" not "this is what the textbook says"

### Costs

**Money:**
- £0 (just used existing phones and free tools)

**Time:**
- James and Sarah: 2 hours customizing policy
- Sarah: 3 hours setting up phones technically
- Team meeting: 15 minutes
- Total: ~5.5 hours

### Lessons Learned

**What worked well:**
- Keeping language casual and direct
- Using real example (Tom's lost phone)
- Doing technical setup before announcing policy
- 15-minute meeting was perfect length

**What they'd do differently:**
- Should have set up Find My Device on company phones ages ago
- Could have been even shorter - some sections are still too formal
- Next time, do the team meeting over lunch with pizza

**Unexpected benefit:**
One of the engineers asked about password managers for his personal stuff after seeing Bitwarden. Now they're all using it personally too.

### Staff Feedback (After 1 Month)

**Tom (Engineer):** "Thought it would be a pain but it's actually fine. The fingerprint unlock is quicker than typing a PIN anyway."

**Dave (Engineer):** "Makes sense. Don't want customer details on my phone if I lose it."

**Sarah (Office Admin):** "Easier to manage than I thought. Monthly check of phones takes 20 minutes."

**James (Director):** "Should've done this years ago. Customer asked about our security on a quote last week - finally had a proper answer."

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

**What made this work:**
1. **Realistic expectations** - didn't try to implement enterprise-level controls
2. **Plain English** - wrote it like they talk
3. **Led by example** - James and Sarah set up their phones first
4. **Quick win** - visible security improvement in 2 weeks
5. **Minimal disruption** - engineers barely noticed the change

**What made it authentic:**
- Used their actual company name and structure
- Referenced their actual software (Tradify, not generic "job management system")
- Included real scenario (Tom's lost phone)
- Admitted it's their first attempt ("we'll learn as we go")

**The difference between this and the template:**
- Template: Comprehensive, covers everything, legally sound
- This version: Practical, specific to NorthWest Heating, gets used

Both are valid. The template gives you options. This shows what one real business actually did.

**This is what a real implementation looks like. Messy, imperfect, but actually done and actually working.**
