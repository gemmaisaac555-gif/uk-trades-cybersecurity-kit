## 📝 How to Customize Policies

### Step 1: Read the Plain English Section
Understand what the policy does and why before customizing.

### Step 2: Download/Copy the Template
Get the formal policy section into a document you can edit.

### Step 3: Replace Placeholders
Find and replace all instances of:
- `[COMPANY NAME]` → Your actual company name
- `[DIRECTOR NAME]` → Actual name
- `[EMAIL]` / `[PHONE]` → Actual contact details
- `[DATE]` → Today's date
- Any other [BRACKETED] items

### Step 4: Adjust for Your Business
Modify sections that don't quite fit:
- Software you use (Xero, Tradify, etc.)
- Number of employees
- Specific devices (Samsung phones, etc.)
- Your actual procedures

**Keep 80% of the template, customize 20%.**

### Step 5: Have Someone Else Read It
Get office manager/colleague to review:
- Is it clear and understandable?
- Does it match what you actually do?
- Any confusing sections?

### Step 6: Save and Version
- Save in company folder (OneDrive, etc.)
- Add version number (v1.0)
- Add review date (annually)
- Keep both Word and PDF versions

- Walk through reporting an incident
- Practice with real examples

**3. Written Materials**
- Provide policy documents
- Create one-page quick reference guide
- Emergency contact cards
- FAQ sheet

**4. Follow-Up**
- Check understanding in first week
- Answer questions as they arise
- Provide additional help where needed

**5. Annual Refresher**
- Review policies annually

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Do we really need formal written policies?"

**Yes, for several reasons:**
- Cyber Essentials certification requires them
- GDPR compliance requires documented procedures
- Customers/tenders increasingly ask for evidence
- Staff need clear expectations
- Protects you legally if something goes wrong

**Without policies:** You're winging it, no evidence of compliance, vulnerable legally.

---

### "Can't we just have one 'Security Policy' instead of five?"

**You could, but:**
- One huge policy is overwhelming to read
- Different policies serve different purposes
- Staff only need relevant policies (engineers don't need full GDPR policy)
- Easier to update individual policies as things change
- Cyber Essentials expects separate policies for different controls

**Separate policies are clearer and more usable.**

---

### "How often do we update policies?"

**Minimum: Annually**

**Also update when:**
- Regulations change (new GDPR guidance, etc.)
- Technology changes (new systems, new software)
- Business changes (new locations, significantly more staff)
- After security incidents (learn and improve)

**Set annual review date when you create each policy.**

---

### "Do policies need to be signed by staff?"

**Best practice: Yes**

**Why:**
- Confirms they've read and understood
- Evidence for compliance (CE, GDPR)
- Protects company if policy violated
- Creates accountability

**How:**
- Simple acknowledgment form
- Digital signature or written
- Keep in employee files
- Update when policies change

---

### "What if staff don't follow the policies?"

**That's what Incident Response and Acceptable Use policies cover:**
- Minor violations: Verbal reminder, retraining
- Moderate violations: Written warning
- Serious violations: Formal disciplinary action
- Gross misconduct: Potential dismissal

**But most violations are accidental - focus on training and support, not punishment.**

---

### "Can we show these to customers/auditors?"

**Data Protection Policy: Yes, publish it**
- Goes on your website as privacy policy
- Share with customers who ask about GDPR
- Include in tenders/proposals

**Other policies: Share summaries**
- Don't share full internal policies externally
- Create summary documents for customers
- Explain your security measures without revealing details
- "Yes, we have password policies requiring MFA and password managers"
