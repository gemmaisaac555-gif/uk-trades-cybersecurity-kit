# Backup and Recovery Policy
### Small Business Information Security Starter Kit

---

> **Before you use this template:** This is a starting point, not a finished document. Read through it, delete anything that doesn't apply to your business, fill in the highlighted sections [IN BRACKETS], and write it in your own words where it makes sense to do so. A policy that sounds like you will get followed. A policy that sounds like a solicitor probably won't.

## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document Owner | [Name and role — the person responsible for backups] |
| Approved By | [Director/Owner name] |
| Approved Date | [Date] |
| Review Date | [One year from approval date] |
| Version | 1.0 |

## 1. Purpose

This policy explains how [Business Name] protects its business data by making regular copies (backups) of important information, and how we would recover that information if something went wrong — such as ransomware, accidental deletion, a hardware failure, or a fire.

The goal is simple: if we lose access to our data today, how quickly can we get back to working normally, and what would we lose?

---

## 2. Why This Matters

Consider what would happen if you lost access to everything tomorrow:

- Customer contact details and job history
- Invoices, quotes, and financial records
- Supplier contacts and purchase history
- Email history
- Any documents, certificates, or insurance records stored digitally

Without backups, some or all of this could be gone permanently. With good backups, recovery is frustrating but manageable.

Under GDPR, we also have a responsibility to protect customer data. Losing it through preventable means (no backups, no recovery plan) is a compliance failure, not just a business inconvenience.

---

## 3. Scope

This policy covers:

- All customer data (contact details, job records, quotes, invoices)
- Financial records (accounting data, invoices, bank records)
- Business email
- Documents and files used in day-to-day operations
- Any software configuration that would take significant time to rebuild

This policy applies to:

- [List the systems you use — e.g. Tradify, Xero, Microsoft 365, QuickBooks, shared drives, local computers, etc.]
- [All employees who manage or access business data]

## 4. What We Back Up and How

### 4.1 Cloud Software (SaaS Applications)

Most modern business software handles backup automatically. The key is knowing what your provider does — and whether it covers the scenarios you're worried about.

| System | What's at risk | Provider backup | What we do additionally |
|---|---|---|---|
| [e.g. Tradify] | Job records, customer data, photos | [Yes/No — check provider] | [e.g. Monthly export to CSV saved to OneDrive] |
| [e.g. Xero] | Financial records, invoices | [Yes — Xero maintains backups] | [e.g. Quarterly export of accounts data] |
| [e.g. Microsoft 365] | Email, OneDrive files, Teams] | [Yes — but recycle bin has limits] | [e.g. Export critical emails annually] |
| [Any other systems] | | | |

**Important:** Cloud provider backups protect against hardware failures on their side. They may NOT protect you against:
- Accidental deletion (some have short recovery windows — check)
- Ransomware that syncs encrypted files to the cloud
- Account being compromised and data deleted maliciously
- Provider going out of business

Check your key providers' backup and recovery terms. Know the answers to: how long do they keep deleted data? Can you restore a specific file from 30 days ago?

---

### 4.2 Local Files and Documents

If you have important files stored locally on computers (not in cloud storage), these need separate backup arrangements.

**What we back up locally:**
[List any local files that aren't automatically in the cloud — e.g. "Quotes folder on office PC", "Scanned certificates in Documents folder"]

**How we back these up:**
[Choose and describe your approach — examples below]

**Option A — External hard drive:**
> We back up the [folder names] on [computer name] to an external hard drive every [weekly/monthly]. The hard drive is stored [offsite location — e.g. "at James's home" or "in a fireproof safe"] when not in use. [Name] is responsible for running the backup.

**Option B — Automatic cloud sync:**
> All important documents are stored in [OneDrive/Google Drive/Dropbox], which automatically syncs to the cloud. We verify the sync is working on the first Monday of each month.

**Option C — Both:**
> Critical files are in OneDrive (automatic sync) and we also run a monthly backup to an external drive as a second copy.

---

### 4.3 The 3-2-1 Rule (Aim For This)

A useful target for backup coverage:
- **3** copies of important data
- **2** different storage types (e.g. cloud + external drive)
- **1** copy stored offsite (not in the same building as the others)

Not every small business needs this level of redundancy for every file. Apply it to your most critical data — the stuff where losing it would seriously damage the business.

---

## 5. How Often We Back Up

| Data Type | Backup Frequency | Who Is Responsible |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud software data (Tradify, Xero, etc.) | Continuous / automatic | [Provider handles — we verify quarterly] |
| Local documents and files | [Weekly/Monthly] | [Name] |
| Email | [Continuous via Microsoft 365] | [Provider handles] |
| Specific exports for offline storage | [Monthly/Quarterly] | [Name] |

## 6. Recovery — What Happens If Something Goes Wrong

### 6.1 Scenarios and Responses

**Scenario: Accidental deletion (one file or folder)**

1. Check recycle bin / recently deleted folder in the relevant system
2. If not there, check if the software has a version history (OneDrive, Google Drive, and most cloud software do)
3. If still not there, contact [Name] who will check backup copies
4. If the file doesn't exist in backups: assess the impact and recreate if necessary

**Scenario: Ransomware (files encrypted, ransom demanded)**

1. Do NOT pay the ransom
2. Disconnect the affected device from the internet and any network immediately
3. Contact [IT support contact / James / whoever handles this]
4. Do NOT attempt to decrypt files yourself
5. Assess what backups are available and whether they're unaffected
6. Report to the National Cyber Security Centre: report.ncsc.gov.uk
7. If customer data is affected, this is likely a reportable data breach — see GDPR guidance
8. Restore from clean backup once the infection has been removed

*Key question: are your backup copies accessible from the infected device? If your backup is a mapped network drive or a synced cloud folder, ransomware may have encrypted those too. Know your answer to this before an incident.*

**Scenario: Hardware failure (computer stops working)**

1. Replace or repair the hardware
2. Restore files from backup / re-access cloud software on new device
3. If cloud software is used for key systems (Tradify, Xero, email), a hardware failure should not cause data loss — just downtime while setting up a replacement

**Scenario: Accidental account deletion or data wipe**

1. Contact the software provider's support immediately — most have a recovery window
2. Check if an export backup exists
3. If data is unrecoverable, assess impact and notify affected customers if required under GDPR

---

### 6.2 Recovery Time Targets

These are targets, not guarantees. The point is to think about what's acceptable before an incident, not after.

| System | Maximum Acceptable Downtime | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Customer job records (Tradify) | [e.g. 24 hours] | Engineers can work from paper/memory for one day |
| Financial records (Xero) | [e.g. 48 hours] | Invoicing can pause briefly |
| Email | [e.g. 4 hours] | Critical for customer communication |
| Local documents | [e.g. 72 hours] | Less time-critical |

---

## 7. Testing Backups

A backup that's never been tested is a backup you don't actually have.

**What we test:**
- Can we access our backup copies?
- Can we restore a specific file?
- Do the backups contain what we expect?

**How often we test:**
[At minimum: once a year. Better: every 6 months. For critical data: quarterly.]

**Our testing schedule:** [Name] will test backup recovery on [month] each year by:
1. Attempting to restore a specific test file from each backup source
2. Checking the date of the most recent backup copy
3. Noting any failures and addressing them

**Record of last test:** [Date / Pass / Fail / Notes]

---

## 8. Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [Director/Owner] | Approves policy, ensures resources are available, reviews after incidents |
| [Office Admin / Named Person] | Runs manual backups, performs monthly checks, contacts providers if issues arise |
| All staff | Report any suspected data loss or suspicious activity immediately |

---

## 9. Key Contacts and Information

| Contact | Details |
|---|---|
| [Software provider 1 — e.g. Tradify] support | [Support email / phone / help URL] |
| [Software provider 2 — e.g. Xero] support | [Support email / phone / help URL] |
| Microsoft 365 support | admin.microsoft.com → Support |
| NCSC incident reporting | report.ncsc.gov.uk |
| ICO (data breach reporting) | ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint — report within 72 hours if customer data affected |
| Our IT support (if applicable) | [Contact name and number, or "None — handle in-house"] |

---

## 10. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed:

- Annually (same time as other security policies)
- After any data loss incident or near-miss
- If we change key software systems
- If our data volume or type changes significantly

---

## Glossary of Terms Used in This Policy

**Backup:** A copy of data stored separately from the original, so if the original is lost or damaged, the copy can be used to restore it.

**Ransomware:** A type of malicious software that encrypts your files and demands payment to unlock them. Even if you pay, there is no guarantee you'll get your data back.

**Cloud software:** Software you access through a web browser or app, where data is stored on the provider's servers rather than your own computer (e.g. Xero, Tradify, Microsoft 365).

**Recovery:** The process of restoring data from a backup after it has been lost or damaged.

**3-2-1 rule:** A backup strategy: 3 copies of data, on 2 different types of storage, with 1 copy stored offsite.

**Data breach:** When personal data is accessed, lost, or stolen without authorisation. Under GDPR, serious breaches must be reported to the ICO within 72 hours.
