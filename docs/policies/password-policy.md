Password Policy
For: Trades businesses needing secure password practices

🔐 Plain English Explanation
What This Policy Covers
This policy sets the rules for creating, using, and managing passwords across all your business systems - email, accounting software, job management apps, everything that needs a login.
Why You Need This
Weak passwords are the #1 way hackers break into small businesses. "Password123" or "CompanyName2024" take seconds to crack. Using the same password everywhere means one breach compromises everything.
You need this policy to:

✅ Meet Cyber Essentials password requirements
✅ Protect customer data under GDPR
✅ Prevent unauthorised access to business systems
✅ Reduce risk of email account compromise
✅ Give clear expectations to all staff

What This Means in Practice
The basics everyone must do:

Use a password manager (like Bitwarden or 1Password) - makes life easier, not harder
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) on critical systems
Never share passwords with colleagues
Use unique passwords for every system
Change password immediately if you think it's been compromised

What changes for staff:

Stop writing passwords on sticky notes
Stop using the same password for work and personal accounts
Stop sharing the "office login" for systems
Install a password manager on phone and computer

What you get:

Much stronger security with less effort
Easy password access across all devices
One click to generate strong passwords
Automatic alerts if passwords are compromised in data breaches

Common Questions
"Isn't a password manager just putting all your eggs in one basket?"
Yes, but that basket is Fort Knox. Password managers use military-grade encryption. The alternative - reusing weak passwords - is far riskier. Plus you'll use MFA on the password manager itself.
"What if we forget the master password?"
Most password managers have recovery options. You'll set this up during implementation. Document the recovery process securely.
"Do we really need different passwords for everything?"
Yes. When hackers steal passwords from one website, they try them everywhere. If you use the same password for email and your accounting software, one breach compromises both.
"What about the office WiFi password - can we share that?"
WiFi passwords can be shared since multiple people need them. But write them down securely (in the password manager!), not on the wall.
"How long do passwords need to be?"
Minimum 12 characters. But with a password manager, you can use 20+ character randomly generated passwords without having to remember them.
"Do we have to change passwords regularly?"
Not anymore! Security guidance has changed - it's better to have strong unique passwords you keep, rather than weak passwords you change monthly. Only change if compromised.

📄 Policy Template
Customize the sections in [brackets] with your business details

Password Security Policy
Document Owner: [Director/Office Manager]
Approved By: [Director Name]
Approved Date: [Date]
Review Date: [Annual review date]
Version: 1.0

1. Purpose
This policy defines password security requirements for all [COMPANY NAME] staff accessing business systems, applications, and data.
2. Scope
This policy applies to:

All company systems requiring authentication (email, accounting, job management, etc.)
Company-owned devices (computers, phones, tablets)
Personal devices used for work (if accessing company systems)
All employees, contractors, and temporary staff
Shared systems (office WiFi, company social media accounts)

3. Password Requirements
3.1 Password Strength
All passwords must meet these minimum standards:
Length:

Minimum 12 characters for standard accounts
Minimum 16 characters for administrator/privileged accounts
Longer is better - aim for 16+ characters for everything

Complexity:

Must include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
OR use a passphrase (4+ random words: "correct-horse-battery-staple")
Avoid dictionary words, common phrases, or personal information

Prohibited passwords:
❌ Company name or variations (e.g., "NorthWest2024")
❌ "Password" or "password" with numbers
❌ Sequential characters ("123456", "abcdef")
❌ Keyboard patterns ("qwerty", "asdfgh")
❌ Personal information (your name, birthday, address, pet names)
❌ Common passwords (check if yours is on "worst passwords" lists)
3.2 Password Uniqueness

Every system must have a different password
Never reuse passwords across systems
Don't reuse old passwords on the same system
Don't use work passwords for personal accounts

3.3 Password Manager Requirement
All staff must use an approved password manager:

Approved tools: [Bitwarden / 1Password / Keeper / Dashlane]
Company will provide [free/paid] accounts
Install on all work devices and personal devices used for work
Use password manager to generate strong random passwords

Why mandatory: You cannot remember 12+ unique 16-character passwords. Password managers solve this.
4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
4.1 MFA Requirement
Multi-Factor Authentication (also called Two-Factor Authentication or 2FA) must be enabled on:
Critical systems (mandatory):

Email accounts (Microsoft 365, Gmail)
Accounting software (Xero, QuickBooks)
Banking and payment systems
Password manager
Administrative access to any system

Recommended for:

Job management software (Tradify, ServiceM8)
Cloud storage (OneDrive, Dropbox)
Social media business accounts
Any system containing customer data

4.2 Acceptable MFA Methods
Preferred (most secure):

Authenticator apps (Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Authy)
Hardware security keys (YubiKey)

Acceptable:

SMS codes to mobile phone (better than nothing)

Not acceptable:

Email-based codes (if your email is compromised, these don't help)

5. Password Storage and Sharing
5.1 Storage
Allowed:

✅ Password manager (approved tools only)
✅ Encrypted digital vault with documented access procedures

Prohibited:

❌ Written on paper/sticky notes
❌ Stored in unencrypted text files or spreadsheets
❌ Saved in browser without master password
❌ Shared in emails or messaging apps
❌ Stored on phones in notes/photos

5.2 Sharing Passwords
General rule: Don't share passwords
Exceptions requiring management approval:

Shared business accounts (company social media)
Shared systems (office WiFi)
Emergency access requirements

How to share when necessary:

Use password manager's secure sharing feature
Document who has access
Change password when person no longer needs access
Never share by email, text, or verbal communication

6. Password Management Practices
6.1 Password Changes
When to change passwords:

✅ Immediately if you suspect compromise
✅ When an employee with access leaves
✅ After a security incident
✅ If the service reports a data breach
✅ If you've shared it and shouldn't have

When NOT to change passwords:

❌ On a regular schedule "just because" (old advice, now considered harmful)
❌ If it's strong, unique, and hasn't been compromised

Why this changed: Frequent mandatory changes encourage people to use weak passwords with small variations (Password1, Password2). Better to have strong passwords you keep.
6.2 Compromised Passwords
If you believe a password has been compromised:

Change it immediately on that system
Check if you've used that password anywhere else and change those too
Report to [IT contact/manager]
Enable MFA if not already enabled
Check account for suspicious activity

Signs a password might be compromised:

You receive password reset emails you didn't request
Account activity you don't recognize
Friends receive spam from your account
You're locked out of your account
Password manager alerts that password appeared in a data breach

7. System-Specific Requirements
7.1 Email Accounts

Minimum 16 characters
MFA mandatory
Check regularly for suspicious logins
Different password from other systems

7.2 Financial Systems (Xero, banking, Stripe)

Minimum 16 characters
MFA mandatory
Review access quarterly
Limit access to only who needs it

7.3 Shared Accounts
For systems requiring shared access (company social media, shared WiFi):

Store password in company password manager
Document who has access
Review access quarterly
Consider individual accounts where possible instead

7.4 Mobile Devices

Device lock screen: Minimum 6-digit PIN or biometric
Separate from password manager master password
Enable biometric unlock (fingerprint/face) for convenience

8. Account Security Best Practices
8.1 Creating Strong Passwords
Option 1: Random generated (best)

Use password manager's generator
16+ characters
Include all character types
You don't need to remember it

Option 2: Passphrase (for passwords you must remember)

Use 4+ random unrelated words
Add numbers and symbols between words
Example: "Brick!Elephant#Umbrella7Mountain"
Longer but easier to remember than random characters

8.2 Security Questions
Many systems ask security questions (mother's maiden name, first pet, etc.):

Don't answer truthfully
This information is often publicly available
Use password manager to store fake answers
Example: Mother's maiden name = "PurplePenguin47"

8.3 Login Monitoring
Staff should regularly check:

Recent login activity on email/critical systems
Devices connected to accounts
Active sessions
Any unfamiliar activity should be reported immediately

9. Special Circumstances
9.1 Temporary Access
For contractors or temporary staff:

Create temporary accounts with unique passwords
