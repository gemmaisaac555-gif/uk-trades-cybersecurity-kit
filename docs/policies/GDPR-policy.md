# GDPR Compliance Checklist for Trades Businesses

**Practical GDPR compliance for small UK trades businesses**

---

## 🎯 What Is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR post-Brexit) is the law governing how you handle customer and employee personal data.

**Personal data** means any information about an identifiable person:
- Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses
- Bank details, payment information
- Photos (including photos of people's homes with them visible)
- Employment records
- Health information (relevant if you handle medical gas systems)

**You must comply with GDPR if:**
- You're a UK business handling personal data (you are)
- You have customers or employees (you do)
- You store, process, or share personal information (you definitely do)

**It's not optional.** But for small trades businesses, compliance is straightforward if you're sensible with data.

---

## 📋 The Seven Principles

GDPR has seven principles. Here's what they mean in practice:

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
**Meaning:** Handle data legally, honestly, and be upfront about what you're doing

**For trades businesses:**
- Have a privacy policy on your website
- Tell customers what data you collect and why
- Don't collect data you don't need
- Don't lie about what you'll do with it

**Check:** [ ] Privacy policy exists and is easy to find

---

### 2. Purpose Limitation
**Meaning:** Only use data for the reason you collected it

**For trades businesses:**
- You collect customer addresses to do the job - fine
- Using those addresses for a marketing campaign - needs consent
- Sharing customer details with a supplier for the job - fine
- Sharing them with an unrelated business - not fine

**Check:** [ ] You only use customer data for the job and legitimate business purposes

---

### 3. Data Minimisation
**Meaning:** Only collect data you actually need

**For trades businesses:**
- Need: Name, address, phone number, payment details
- Don't need: Date of birth, gender, ethnicity
- Borderline: Email (useful for job confirmations but not essential)

**Check:** [ ] You don't ask for unnecessary personal information

---

### 4. Accuracy
**Meaning:** Keep data accurate and up-to-date

**For trades businesses:**
- Update customer details when they move/change phone number
- Delete old addresses after customer moves
- Correct errors when you find them

**Check:** [ ] You update customer records when they change

---

### 5. Storage Limitation
**Meaning:** Don't keep data longer than necessary

**For trades businesses:**
- Keep job records for 6 years (tax law requirement)
- Keep gas safety certificates for 2 years (legal requirement)
- Delete old customer records if they haven't used you in years
- Delete ex-employee records after 6 years

**Check:** [ ] You have a policy for deleting old data

---

### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)
**Meaning:** Protect data from unauthorized access or loss

**For trades businesses:**
- Password-protect your systems
- Don't leave customer details visible in the van
- Encrypt devices with customer data
- Back up so you don't lose data

**Check:** [ ] You have security measures in place (see Cyber Essentials checklist)

---

### 7. Accountability
**Meaning:** You can demonstrate compliance

**For trades businesses:**
- Document what data you hold
- Document how you protect it
- Keep records of data processing activities
- Be able to show you're compliant if asked

**Check:** [ ] You can explain what data you have and how you protect it

---

## ✅ Practical Compliance Checklist

### 1. Know What Data You Hold

**Create a data inventory:**

**Customer Data:**
- [ ] Where do you store customer names/addresses? (Tradify, Xero, email, etc.)
- [ ] Where do you store phone numbers? (Tradify, phones, paper records)
- [ ] Where do you store email addresses? (Email system, CRM)
- [ ] Where do you store payment details? (Xero, Stripe - most payment processors handle this securely)
- [ ] Where do you store gas certificates/job records? (OneDrive, email, paper files)
- [ ] Where do you store photos of customers' homes? (Tradify, phones)

**Employee Data:**
- [ ] Where do you store employee records? (OneDrive, HR files, paper files)
- [ ] Where do you store payroll information? (Payroll software, accountant)
- [ ] Where do you store right-to-work documents? (Office files, OneDrive)
- [ ] Where do you store emergency contacts? (Office files, paper)

**Write it down.** Literally make a list. This is your "data map."

**For NorthWest Heating:**
- Customer data: Tradify (job info), Xero (invoices), OneDrive (gas certificates)
- Employee data: OneDrive (contracts, right-to-work), payroll software (PAYE info)
- Photos: Tradify (job photos), engineers' phones (temporary until uploaded)

---

### 2. Have a Privacy Policy

**What it is:** A document explaining how you handle personal data

**What it must include:**
- [ ] Your business name and contact details
- [ ] What personal data you collect
- [ ] Why you collect it (legal basis)
- [ ] How long you keep it
- [ ] Who you share it with (subcontractors, suppliers)
- [ ] How people can access/correct/delete their data
- [ ] How to complain to the ICO

**Where it goes:**
- [ ] Your website (footer link is fine)
- [ ] Provide to customers if they ask
- [ ] Include in quotes/contracts for larger jobs

**Template available:** Use the [Data Protection Policy](../policies/data-protection-policy.md) as a starting point

**For NorthWest Heating:** Created 2-page privacy policy, put on website footer, takes 10 minutes to read.

---

### 3. Legal Basis for Processing Data

**You need a legal reason to process personal data. For trades businesses:**

**Contract (most common):**
- Customer data for doing the job = legitimate
- "We need your address to know where to come do the work"
- "We need your phone number to confirm appointments"
- **This covers 90% of what you do**

**Legal obligation:**
- Keeping records for tax purposes = legitimate
- Keeping gas safety certificates (legal requirement) = legitimate

**Legitimate interests:**
- Sending quotes/invoices = legitimate business need
- Following up on unpaid invoices = legitimate
- Keeping records for warranty purposes = legitimate

**Consent (rarely needed for B2B):**
- Marketing emails = need consent
- Sharing data with partners for non-job purposes = need consent
- Taking photos in someone's home (if people visible) = good practice to ask

**For each type of data you process, document the legal basis:**

- [ ] Customer contact details for jobs → Contract
- [ ] Payment information for invoicing → Contract
- [ ] Employee records → Contract + Legal obligation
- [ ] Marketing emails → Consent

**For NorthWest Heating:** 
- Job-related data: Contract
- Tax records: Legal obligation  
- Newsletter: Consent (checkbox on website quote form)

---

### 4. Data Subject Rights

**People have rights over their data. You must respond within 30 days.**

**Right to be informed:**
- [ ] Privacy policy explains what you do with data

**Right of access (Subject Access Request - SAR):**
- [ ] If someone asks "what data do you hold on me?" you must tell them
- [ ] Free of charge
- [ ] 30 days to respond
- [ ] Include: what data, why you have it, who you've shared it with

**Right to rectification:**
- [ ] If someone says "my address is wrong," you must correct it
- [ ] 30 days to comply

**Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"):**
- [ ] If someone asks you to delete their data, you usually must
- [ ] **Exception:** If you need it for legal reasons (tax, gas safety records)
- [ ] Can refuse if legal obligation to keep data
- [ ] Must explain why if you refuse

**Right to restrict processing:**
- [ ] If someone disputes data accuracy, you must restrict use while investigating

**Right to data portability:**
- [ ] Not usually relevant for trades businesses
- [ ] Would mean providing data in machine-readable format if asked

**Right to object:**
- [ ] If someone objects to marketing, stop immediately
- [ ] Must honor "no marketing" requests

**Create a process:**
- [ ] Who handles data requests? (probably you/office admin)
- [ ] How do you verify identity? (ask for booking reference + address)
- [ ] How do you gather the data? (search Tradify, Xero, email)
- [ ] How do you deliver it? (email PDF, letter)

**For NorthWest Heating:** Sarah handles requests, verifies via booking ref, searches systems, responds within 2 weeks.

---

### 5. Data Security

**You must protect personal data "appropriately."**

**For a small trades business, this means:**

**Technical measures:**
- [ ] Passwords on all systems (use password manager)
- [ ] MFA on critical systems
- [ ] Encryption on devices (computers, phones)
- [ ] Antivirus on computers
- [ ] Regular backups
- [ ] Firewall on network

**See:** [Cyber Essentials Checklist](cyber-essentials-checklist.md) covers all of this

**Organisational measures:**
- [ ] Staff know how to handle data securely
- [ ] Clear desk policy (don't leave customer details visible)
- [ ] Shred paper with personal data
- [ ] Don't discuss customers where others can overhear
- [ ] Remove employee access when they leave

**Physical security:**
- [ ] Office locked when empty
- [ ] Paper files in locked cabinet
- [ ] Don't leave customer details in unlocked van
- [ ] Dispose of old paperwork securely (shred or burn)

**For NorthWest Heating:** 
- Password manager + MFA (technical)
- Staff briefed on data handling (organisational)
- Office has locked filing cabinet (physical)

---

### 6. Data Breaches

**A data breach is when data is lost, stolen, or accessed by unauthorized people.**

**Examples:**
- Phone with customer data gets stolen
- Email account hacked and customer details exposed
- Customer file left in cafe
- Send email with all customer addresses in "To:" instead of "BCC:"

**Your obligations:**

**Must assess severity:**
- [ ] Low risk = tell affected people, document it
- [ ] High risk = tell ICO within 72 hours + tell affected people

**High risk means:**
- Financial information exposed
- Large number of people affected
- Sensitive data (health, ethnicity, religion)
- Data could cause harm/distress if misused

**Document all breaches:**
- [ ] What happened
- [ ] What data was involved
- [ ] How many people affected
- [ ] What you did to fix it
- [ ] What you'll do to prevent recurrence

**Create a breach response plan:**
1. Discover breach (someone reports phone lost, etc.)
2. Contain it (remotely wipe phone, change passwords)
3. Assess impact (what data was on there? how many customers?)
4. Notify if necessary (ICO if high risk, customers always)
5. Document everything
6. Learn and improve

**For NorthWest Heating:** 
- Incident log in OneDrive
- Sarah handles breach response
- Process documented in incident response policy
- Haven't had a reportable breach yet (touch wood)

---

### 7. Third-Party Data Processors

**If you share customer data with other companies, you need agreements.**

**Who are your processors?**
- [ ] Accounting software (Xero)
- [ ] Job management (Tradify)
- [ ] Email provider (Microsoft)
- [ ] Cloud storage (OneDrive)
- [ ] Payment processor (Stripe)
- [ ] Payroll provider
- [ ] Accountant
- [ ] Subcontractors (if you share customer details)

**What you need:**
- [ ] Check their privacy policy/terms (they'll have GDPR compliance info)
- [ ] Confirm they're secure (reputable providers are)
- [ ] Document who you share data with and why
- [ ] For subcontractors: Contract clause about data protection

**Most SaaS providers (Xero, Microsoft, etc.) have standard GDPR-compliant terms. You don't need separate agreements.**

**For subcontractors/suppliers you share customer details with:**
- [ ] Add clause to contract: "You must handle customer data in accordance with GDPR"
- [ ] Confirm they won't use data for other purposes
- [ ] Confirm they'll delete data when job is done

**For NorthWest Heating:**
- Software providers: Checked GDPR compliance in their terms
- Subcontractors: Added data protection clause to standard terms
- Documented all processors in privacy policy

---

### 8. Marketing and Consent

**If you want to send marketing emails/texts:**

**Business-to-Consumer (B2C - homeowners):**
- [ ] Need explicit opt-in consent
- [ ] Must be clear checkbox, not pre-ticked
- [ ] Must say what they're signing up for
- [ ] Must be easy to unsubscribe
- [ ] Must honor unsubscribe immediately

**Business-to-Business (B2B - commercial customers):**
- [ ] Can email without consent (soft opt-in)
- [ ] But must still allow unsubscribe
- [ ] Can't sell/share their details

**Best practice for all:**
- [ ] Add checkbox to quote forms: "Send me tips and special offers"
- [ ] Include unsubscribe link in every email
- [ ] Keep list of who's opted in/out
- [ ] Don't buy email lists (seriously, don't)

**For NorthWest Heating:**
- Checkbox on website quote form for newsletter
- Only send to people who ticked it
- "Unsubscribe" link at bottom of emails
- 47 people on list currently

---

### 9. International Data Transfers

**Do you send data outside the UK?**

**For most trades businesses: No**

**Possible scenarios:**
- Using US-based software (often fine - check their UK data residency)
- Emailing customers abroad (rare for trades)
- Cloud storage with international servers

**Check your main tools:**
- [ ] Xero: UK/EU data centers
- [ ] Microsoft 365: UK data residency option
- [ ] Tradify: Check their data policy

**If you do transfer data internationally:**
- Check provider has "adequacy decision" or "standard contractual clauses"
- Most reputable providers handle this automatically
- Document it in your privacy policy

**For NorthWest Heating:** 
- All data stays in UK/EU
- Microsoft 365 UK region
- Xero UK entity
- No international transfers

---

### 10. Staff Training and Awareness

**Your team must understand data protection basics.**

**Minimum training (30 minutes):**
- [ ] What is personal data
- [ ] How we handle it at [Company Name]
- [ ] Don't share customer details inappropriately
- [ ] Lock devices, don't leave paperwork lying around
- [ ] Report lost devices immediately
- [ ] Report data breaches immediately
- [ ] Don't discuss customers where others can overhear

**Repeat annually**

**Document that you did it:**
- Date of training
- Who attended
- What was covered
- Keep in employee files

**For NorthWest Heating:**
- 20-minute briefing during monthly team meeting
- Covered: what's personal data, where we store it, phone security, report breaches
- Verbal acknowledgment from all staff
- Documented in meeting notes

---

### 11. Children's Data

**Special rules if you handle data about children (under 16 in UK).**

**For trades businesses:**
- Generally not collecting children's data
- If you fix a boiler and kids live there, you're not processing their data
- If you take photos and a child is visible, get parent consent

**Be cautious with:**
- [ ] Photos that include children
- [ ] Collecting data about children specifically
- [ ] Marketing to families (must be directed at adults)

**For NorthWest Heating:**
- Don't collect children's data
- If child visible in job photo, delete photo or blur face
- Not an issue in practice

---

### 12. Data Protection Officer (DPO)

**Do you need a DPO?**

**For small trades businesses: Almost certainly no**

**You only need a DPO if:**
- You're a public authority, OR
- You do large-scale systematic monitoring, OR
- You process special category data at scale

**Trades business = none of these apply**

**Instead:**
- [ ] Designate someone responsible for GDPR (director/office manager)
- [ ] Make them the contact point for data requests
- [ ] Document this in privacy policy

**For NorthWest Heating:**
- Sarah is GDPR contact (not formally a DPO)
- Handles data requests and compliance
- Listed in privacy policy

---

### 13. Record Keeping

**You must document your data processing activities if you have 250+ employees.**

**For small trades businesses (under 250 employees):**
- Not strictly required
- **But good practice anyway**
- Helps you demonstrate compliance

**Simple record to keep:**
- What data you collect
- Why you collect it
- Legal basis
- How long you keep it
- Who you share it with
- How you protect it

**This is basically your privacy policy in internal format.**

**For NorthWest Heating:**
- Created simple data processing record (2 pages)
- Reviewed annually
- Kept in office + OneDrive

---

## 🚨 Common GDPR Mistakes for Trades Businesses

**Avoid these:**

❌ **No privacy policy** - even if you're small, you need one

❌ **Keeping data forever** - set deletion schedules

❌ **Sharing customer details with subcontractors without telling customers** - mention it in privacy policy

❌ **Using personal email for business** - customer data should be in business systems

❌ **No backup** - losing data violates GDPR (you must protect against loss)

❌ **Ex-employees still have access** - revoke immediately when they leave

❌ **Engineers texting customer addresses to each other** - use Tradify, not personal texts

❌ **Customer spreadsheet on personal laptop with no password** - encrypt devices

❌ **Buying email lists** - don't do it, ever

❌ **Ignoring unsubscribe requests** - respond immediately

---

## 💰 Cost of Non-Compliance

**What happens if you don't comply?**

**ICO can fine you up to:**
- £8.7 million, OR
- 2% of annual turnover

**For serious breaches:** Up to £17.5 million or 4% of turnover

**In practice for small businesses:**
- First offense: Usually a warning
- Minor breach: £1,000-10,000 fine
- Serious breach: Can be £50,000+
- Reputation damage: Can kill a small business

**Recent real examples:**
- Small letting agent: £80,000 fine for data breach
- Estate agent: £80,000 fine for spam emails
- Tradesman: £5,000 fine for not responding to data request

**Prevention is much cheaper than fines.**

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

**Starting from scratch? Here's a realistic plan:**

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Map where your data lives (2 hours)
- [ ] Review your current security (1 hour)
- [ ] List your third-party processors (30 minutes)

### Week 2: Documentation
- [ ] Create privacy policy (2 hours, use template)
- [ ] Document legal basis for processing (1 hour)
- [ ] Create data breach response process (1 hour)

### Week 3: Security
- [ ] Implement technical security (follow Cyber Essentials checklist)
- [ ] Create data retention policy (1 hour)
- [ ] Set up process for data requests (1 hour)

### Week 4: Training and Launch
- [ ] Brief staff on GDPR (30 minutes)
- [ ] Add privacy policy to website (30 minutes)
- [ ] Review and finalize everything (1 hour)

**Total time: ~15-20 hours over 4 weeks**

If you've already done the [30-Day Quick Start](../implementation/30-day-quick-start.md), you're 70% done with GDPR already (security measures in place).

## 📋 Quick "Customer Asked" Responses

**When a customer asks:** "Are you GDPR compliant?"

**Say:** "Yes, we comply with UK GDPR. We have security measures in place to protect your data, we only use your information for the job and legitimate business purposes, and we have a privacy policy you can see on our website."

**When they ask:** "What data do you collect?"

**Say:** "Just what we need for the job - your name, address, phone number, and email for job confirmations. We keep records for tax purposes and gas safety certificates as legally required. We don't share your data except with software providers like Xero for invoicing."

**When they ask:** "How long do you keep my data?"

**Say:** "Job records for 6 years for tax purposes, gas safety certificates for 2 years as legally required. After that, we delete details unless you're a regular customer."

**When they ask:** "Can I see what data you have on me?"

**Say:** "Yes, just email us at [email] and we'll send you everything we hold within 30 days. No charge."

## ❓ Common Questions

**"Do I need to register with the ICO?"**
Most trades businesses don't need to pay the £40-60 ICO fee unless processing data is your core business. But check: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-fee/

**"What if I only do commercial work, not domestic?"**
GDPR still applies. Business contact details are personal data.

**"Can I use WhatsApp for work?"**
Yes, but be aware customer data ends up on personal phones. Better to use business phone numbers and proper systems.

**"Do I need consent to take photos at job sites?"**
If photos show identifiable people, yes. If just showing the boiler/installation, no.

**"What about CCTV in the office/van?"**
Need signs saying it's in use. If you record staff, more rules apply. Check ICO guidance.

---

**GDPR isn't as scary as it sounds. For small trades businesses, it's mostly common sense: collect only what you need, keep it secure, don't share it inappropriately, delete it when done.**

**If you're sensible with customer data, you're probably 90% compliant already.**
