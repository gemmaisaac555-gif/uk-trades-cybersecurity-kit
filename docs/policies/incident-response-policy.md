# Incident Response Policy

**What to do when something goes wrong**

---

## 🎯 Plain English Explanation

### What This Policy Covers

This policy explains what to do when you have a security incident - things like lost phones, suspected hacking, phishing emails, data breaches, ransomware, or any other security problem.

### Why You Need This

When something goes wrong, people panic. This policy gives clear steps so everyone knows exactly what to do, who to contact, and how to fix it quickly.

**Without a plan:** Chaos, poor decisions, delays that make things worse  
**With a plan:** Fast response, contained damage, lessons learned

### What Counts as an Incident

**Definite incidents:**
- Lost or stolen device with customer data
- Email account compromised
- Suspected ransomware or malware
- Unauthorized access to systems
- Data sent to wrong person
- Website hacked or defaced

**Suspicious but unclear:**
- Strange emails from colleagues
- Unexpected password reset requests
- Unusual system behavior
- Unknown devices on network

**When in doubt, report it.** False alarms are fine. Unreported incidents are disasters.

### 4. Immediate Response Steps

**If you discover or suspect an incident:**

### STEP 1: STOP AND CONTAIN (Immediately)

**For lost/stolen devices:**
- [ ] Report immediately to [INCIDENT COORDINATOR]
- [ ] Note what data was on the device
- [ ] Last known location
- [ ] Don't delay - call even outside work hours

**For compromised accounts:**
- [ ] Change password immediately (if you still have access)
- [ ] Report to [INCIDENT COORDINATOR]
- [ ] Don't use the account until cleared
- [ ] Check for suspicious activity (sent emails, changed settings)

**For phishing/suspicious emails:**
- [ ] Don't click links or open attachments
- [ ] Don't reply or provide information
- [ ] Forward to [INCIDENT COORDINATOR] or [SECURITY EMAIL]
- [ ] Delete email

**For malware/ransomware:**
- [ ] Disconnect device from network IMMEDIATELY (unplug ethernet, disable WiFi)
- [ ] Don't turn off device (may lose evidence)
- [ ] Photo the screen if there's a ransom message
- [ ] Report to [INCIDENT COORDINATOR]
- [ ] Don't pay ransom without professional advice

**For unauthorized access:**
- [ ] Change passwords immediately
- [ ] Enable MFA if not already active
- [ ] Report to [INCIDENT COORDINATOR]
- [ ] Log what was accessed

### STEP 2: REPORT (Within 1 hour if possible)

**Call/Text:** [INCIDENT COORDINATOR MOBILE]  
**Email:** [INCIDENT EMAIL]  
**Out of hours:** Still report - don't wait until morning

**What to report:**
- What happened (as you understand it)
- When it happened
- What systems/data affected
- What actions you've taken
- Your contact details

**Don't worry about:**
- Whether you're overreacting (better safe than sorry)
- Getting in trouble (mistakes happen, hiding them makes it worse)
- Looking stupid (better to report false alarm than miss real incident)

### STEP 3: PRESERVE EVIDENCE (Don't destroy anything)

**Do:**
- Take photos/screenshots if safe to do so
- Note times and what you observed
- Keep emails/messages related to incident
- Write down what happened while fresh in mind

**Don't:**

## 📊 NorthWest Heating Example

**Their incident coordinator:** Sarah (office admin)  
**Backup:** James (director)  
**Reporting:** Text/call Sarah's mobile anytime: 07XXX XXXXXX

**Incidents they've had:**
1. Tom left phone at job site (reported immediately, recovered same day)
2. Suspicious email to James (forwarded to Sarah, confirmed phishing, deleted)
3. Dave clicked link in fake invoice email (changed password immediately, no compromise)

**None were serious because they were reported quickly.**
