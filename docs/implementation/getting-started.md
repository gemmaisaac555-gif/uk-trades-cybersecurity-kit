# Getting Started with the UK Trades Security Kit

**Your first steps to implementing security in your trades business**

---

## 👋 Welcome

You've found this security kit because you need to improve your business's security - maybe a customer asked about GDPR, maybe you need Cyber Essentials for a tender, or maybe you just know it's time to take security seriously.

**Good news:** You're in the right place. This kit gives you everything you need.

**Better news:** It's designed specifically for trades businesses like yours - plumbers, electricians, heating engineers, builders - not tech companies.

**Best news:** Other businesses your size have done this in 90 days while running their business. You can too.

---

## 🤔 Is This Kit Right for You?

**This kit is perfect if:**
- You're a UK trades business with 2-20 employees
- You need Cyber Essentials certification
- Customers are asking about GDPR compliance
- You want to improve security but don't know where to start
- You can't afford (or don't want) expensive consultants
- You use common business software (Xero, Microsoft 365, job management apps)

**This kit might not be right if:**
- You're a large organization (50+ employees) - you probably need enterprise solutions
- You're not UK-based - this is aligned with UK frameworks
- You already have Cyber Essentials - though you might find the policies useful
- You're a tech company - this is written for non-technical businesses

**Still here? Great, let's get started.**

**Timeline:** 60-90 days

**Your route:**
1. Start immediately with [30-Day Quick Start](30-day-quick-start.md)
2. While waiting for Week 2 tasks, read [Cyber Essentials Checklist](../checklists/cyber-essentials-checklist.md)

4. Complete GDPR documentation in parallel

**Priority:** Speed, but don't skip the 30-day foundation

---

### Path 2: "Customers Keep Asking About GDPR" (Important)

**Timeline:** 30-60 days

**Your route:**
1. Start with [30-Day Quick Start](30-day-quick-start.md) (security basics first)
2. Week 3-4: Focus heavily on [Data Protection Policy](../policies/data-protection-policy.md)
3. Complete [GDPR Compliance Checklist](../checklists/gdpr-compliance-checklist.md)
4. Add privacy policy to website
5. Document data handling procedures

**Priority:** GDPR compliance with security foundation

---

### Path 3: "We Should Probably Do Security Properly" (Proactive)

**Timeline:** 90 days (no rush)

**Your route:**
1. Start with [30-Day Quick Start](30-day-quick-start.md)
2. Follow [90-Day Plan](90-day-plan.md) completely
3. Take time to understand and customize everything
4. Build sustainable processes
5. Achieve Cyber Essentials at the end

**Priority:** Comprehensive implementation, done properly

---

### Path 4: "I Just Want to Know What to Do First" (Overwhelmed)

**Your immediate actions:**
1. Read [30-Day Quick Start - Week 1](30-day-quick-start.md#week-1-passwords--mfa-the-foundation) (just Week 1)
2. Choose a password manager (Bitwarden is free and good)
3. Set it up for yourself first
4. Enable MFA on your email today
5. Come back tomorrow and continue Week 1

**Priority:** One small step at a time, build momentum

---

## 📖 How to Use This Kit

### Step 1: Understand Where You Are

**Take 30 minutes to assess:**
- What security do you already have?
- What are customers/tenders requiring?
- How much time can you dedicate? (5 hours/week minimum)
- Who will lead this? (Usually director or office manager)

**Use:** [NorthWest Heating Business Profile](../worked-example/northwest-heating/overview.md) to compare

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Timeline

**Realistic options:**
- **30 days:** Basic security foundation
- **60 days:** Foundation + GDPR or CE preparation
- **90 days:** Complete implementation to certification

**Be honest about available time.** Better to take 120 days and do it properly than rush and do it poorly.

---

### Step 3: Start With Week 1

**Everyone starts here:** [30-Day Quick Start - Week 1](30-day-quick-start.md#week-1-passwords--mfa-the-foundation)

**Why Week 1 is non-negotiable:**
- Passwords and MFA prevent 80% of attacks
- Foundation for everything else
- Quick wins build momentum
- Team gets used to security tools

**Don't skip ahead.** Week 1 takes 3-4 hours. Just do it.

---

### Step 4: Use the Templates

**Don't start from scratch:**
- All policies have ready-to-use templates
- Just customize [COMPANY NAME] placeholders
- Keep the structure, adapt the details
- Use [NorthWest Heating examples](../worked-example/) to see how

**Customizing is 10x faster than creating.**

---

### Step 5: Reference the Worked Example

**When you hit challenges:**
- Check if [NorthWest Heating faced the same](../worked-example/northwest-heating-implementation-journey.md)
- See how they solved it
- Learn from their mistakes
- Verify you're on track

**You're not alone - someone's done this before.**

---

### Step 6: Track Your Progress

**Simple tracking:**
- Print the relevant checklist
- Tick off items as you complete them
- Celebrate small wins
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of done

**Forward progress beats perfection.**

## ❓ Common Questions Before Starting

### "How is this different from just asking ChatGPT for policies?"

**This kit provides:**
- UK-specific guidance (Cyber Essentials, GDPR, ICO)
- Realistic implementation plans with time estimates
- Worked example showing actual challenges
- Everything integrated (policies reference each other)
- Trades-specific language and examples

**ChatGPT gives:** Generic policies that might not be UK-compliant, no implementation guidance, no proof it works.

---

### "Do we really need to do all of this?"

**Minimum for basic compliance:**
- 30-Day Quick Start (must do)
- Data Protection Policy (GDPR requirement)
- Security basics documented

**Recommended for Cyber Essentials:**
- Full 90-Day Plan
- All policies
- Risk assessment

**You choose based on your needs.** But more is better.

---

### "What if we get stuck or have questions?"

**Resources in this kit:**
- Worked example shows common challenges and solutions
- Each document has troubleshooting sections
- Checklists verify you're on track

**External resources:**
- NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/smallbusiness
- ICO guidance: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/sme-web-hub/
- Cyber Essentials support: Via certification body

**This kit is designed to be self-service, but help is available if needed.**

---

### "Can we hire someone to do this for us?"

**You could, but:**
- Consultants charge £2,000-5,000+ for what this kit provides
- You'd still need to implement and maintain it
- You wouldn't understand your own security

**Better approach:**
- Use this kit to do it yourself
- Hire help only for specific gaps (e.g., website changes)
- Learn as you go - security is ongoing, not one-time

---

### "What if our business changes?"

**This kit is flexible:**
- Policies are templates you can update
- Scale up as you grow (add more employees to training, etc.)
- Scale down if you downsize
- Review annually and adjust

**Security grows with your business.**
