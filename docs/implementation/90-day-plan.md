## ❓ Common Questions

**"What if we can't complete everything in 90 days?"**
Take your time. Better to do it properly than rush. Aim for 120 days if needed.

**"Do we need to do everything in order?"**
Mostly yes. Some flexibility, but don't skip the 30-Day Quick Start foundations.

**"What if we fail Cyber Essentials first time?"**
Common. You get feedback, fix issues (usually 1-2 weeks), resubmit. Most pass second time.

**"Can we maintain this long-term?"**
Yes. After initial setup, it's 30 minutes monthly, 1 hour quarterly, half day annually.

**"What if our business grows significantly?"**
Good problem! Review security measures when you hit 15+ employees or expand significantly.

**You've built proper security in 90 days. That's impressive. Now maintain it, and security becomes business-as-usual rather than a project.**

**Well done.**
