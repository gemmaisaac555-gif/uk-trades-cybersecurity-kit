# 30-Day Security Quick Start

**Get your trades business security sorted in one month**

---

## 🎯 What This Is

A realistic, prioritized plan to implement essential security in 30 days. Not everything - just the critical stuff that protects you from 80% of threats while you're getting started.

**Designed for:**
- Trades businesses with no existing security measures
- Owner/director doing this themselves
- ~2-3 hours per week time investment
- Minimal budget (mostly free tools)

**What you'll achieve:**
- ✅ Protection against common threats (phishing, password attacks, lost phones)
- ✅ Foundations for Cyber Essentials certification
- ✅ Confident answers to customer GDPR questions
- ✅ Documented policies you actually use
- ✅ Staff who understand basic security

## 📅 Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1: Passwords & MFA (The Foundation)
**Time needed:** 3-4 hours

#### Monday-Tuesday: Password Manager Setup
**What to do:**
1. Choose a password manager (recommend: Bitwarden free or 1Password business)
2. Sign up for accounts - one for you, one for office admin, one for each engineer
3. Install on your computer and phone
4. Create a strong master password you can remember (4+ random words)

**Why this first:**
Weak passwords are the #1 way businesses get hacked. This solves it immediately and makes everything else easier.

**Common issue:**
"This feels complicated." It does for the first 2 days. By day 3 it's easier than remembering passwords. By day 7 you'll wonder how you lived without it.

#### Wednesday-Friday: Enable MFA Everywhere Critical
**What to do:**
1. Enable MFA on your email (Microsoft 365) - this is CRITICAL
2. Enable MFA on Xero/accounting software
3. Enable MFA on password manager
4. Enable MFA on online banking
5. Add authenticator app to your phone (Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator)

**Why this matters:**
Even if someone steals your password, they can't get in without the second factor (your phone).

**Time investment:**
- 10-15 minutes per system
- ~1-2 hours total
- Do it all in one sitting while you're in the zone

**Week 1 Outcome:**
Your most critical accounts (email, money, passwords) are now dramatically more secure.

### Week 2: Secure the Phones (Protect Customer Data)
**Time needed:** 2-3 hours

#### Monday-Tuesday: Audit Current Situation
**What to do:**
1. List all phones used for work (company phones + personal if used)
2. Check each phone: Is there a screen lock? Is it updated?
3. Check what work apps are on each phone
4. Check what customer data is stored on phones

**Write down:**
- How many phones total
- Which are company owned vs personal
- What data is on them
- Current security status

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Lock Down Company Phones
**What to do for each company phone:**
1. Enable screen lock (6-digit PIN minimum or fingerprint)
2. Enable Find My iPhone / Find My Device
3. Check encryption is enabled (it is by default on modern phones)
4. Update to latest operating system
5. Remove any unnecessary apps
6. Install password manager

**Time per phone:** 20-30 minutes

#### Friday: Mobile Device Policy
**What to do:**
1. Customize the [Mobile Device Policy template](../policies/06-mobile-device-policy.md)
2. Print one copy for the office
3. Email to all staff
4. Have a 10-minute team huddle explaining the key points
5. Get verbal acknowledgment from everyone

**Don't overthink this:**
You're not writing a legal document. You're setting clear expectations: "Phones need PINs, keep them updated, report if lost."

**Week 2 Outcome:**
Customer data on phones is protected. Staff know the rules. You can confidently say "yes" if a customer asks if you secure mobile devices.

---

### Week 3: Email Security & Backup (Prevent Disasters)
**Time needed:** 2-3 hours

#### Monday-Tuesday: Email Security
**What to do:**
1. Check your email domain's security settings (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - If using Microsoft 365, these are mostly handled automatically
   - Check via: https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx
2. Set up email retention policy (keep emails for X years)
3. Enable "mailbox audit logging" if using Microsoft 365
4. Create a shared mailbox for info@ if you don't have one
5. Remove any ex-employees' email access (yes, check this)

**If you see SPF/DKIM/DMARC aren't configured:**
- It's a 30-minute job for whoever manages your domain
- Prevents people sending fake emails pretending to be you
- Critical for preventing invoice fraud

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Backup Strategy
**What to do:**
1. List what MUST be backed up:
   - Customer data (it's in Xero/Tradify mostly, right?)
   - Gas safety certificates (OneDrive? Email? Get them organized)
   - Employee records
   - Any other critical files

2. Check where backups currently go:
   - Is Xero backing up? (Yes, automatically)
   - Is OneDrive backing up? (Yes, if you're using it properly)
   - Are gas certificates in OneDrive or sitting on someone's desktop?

3. Fix any gaps:
   - Move critical files to OneDrive if not there already
   - Delete ancient files you don't need
   - Organize into clear folders

4. Test a restore:
   - Try recovering a deleted file from OneDrive
   - Make sure you can actually get files back if needed

#### Friday: Backup Policy
**What to do:**
1. Document your backup approach (even if it's simple)
2. Who's responsible for checking backups?
3. How often do you check?
4. Where are the most critical files?

**Write this down in plain English:**
"Gas certificates go in OneDrive > Certificates folder. Xero backs up automatically. Office admin checks monthly that files are syncing."

**Week 3 Outcome:**
Email security prevents impersonation attacks. Backups mean you won't lose everything if something goes wrong. You sleep better.

### Week 4: Documentation & Team Training (Make It Stick)
**Time needed:** 3-4 hours

#### Monday-Tuesday: Core Policy Documents
**What to do:**
1. Customize these three essential policies:
   - [Password Policy](../policies/password-policy.md)
   - [Mobile Device Policy](../policies/06-mobile-device-policy.md)  
   - [Acceptable Use Policy](../policies/02-acceptable-use-policy.md)

2. Keep it simple:
   - Replace [COMPANY NAME] with your actual company name
   - Set realistic timeframes
   - Make sure nothing contradicts what you're already doing

3. Save them all in one folder (OneDrive > Company Policies)

**Don't:**
- Spend hours perfecting wording
- Create policies for things you don't actually do
- Make it so formal that no one will read it

**Do:**
- Make it clear and practical
- Focus on "this is what we do and why"
- Keep language simple

#### Wednesday: Team Security Training
**What to do:**
Schedule a 30-minute team meeting (or two 15-minute huddles if easier):

**Cover:**
1. **Why we're doing this:**
   - Customers are asking about security
   - We need Cyber Essentials for some contracts
   - Protecting customer data is the law
   - This protects our business

2. **What changes for you:**
   - Use password manager (show them how)
   - Keep phones locked and updated
   - Think before clicking links in emails
   - Report anything suspicious immediately

3. **What stays the same:**
   - You can still use your phones normally
   - We're not monitoring your personal stuff
   - This makes life easier, not harder

4. **Questions and concerns:**
   - Actually listen
   - Address worries
   - Be patient with less tech-savvy team members

**Give everyone:**
- Written copy of the policies (or link to them)
- Password manager login details
- Your contact details for questions

#### Thursday-Friday: Create Your Security Handbook
**What to do:**
Create one simple document that pulls it all together:

**Include:**
- Who's responsible for security (probably you)
- Where policies are stored
- Emergency contacts if something goes wrong
- Quick reference: "I think I clicked a dodgy link - what do I do?"
- Quick reference: "My phone was stolen - what do I do?"
- Quick reference: "A customer asked if we're GDPR compliant - what do I say?"

**Keep it to 2-3 pages maximum.**

Save it somewhere everyone can access: OneDrive > Security folder

**Week 4 Outcome:**
Team knows what's expected. Policies are documented. You have answers to common security questions. You're no longer winging it.

## ❓ Common Problems & Solutions

### "We tried password managers before and everyone hated it"
**Solution:** Lead by example. Use it yourself for 2 weeks first. Show the team how it makes life easier. Do hands-on training, not just "here's the login."

### "The lads won't want to put work apps on their personal phones"
**Solution:** Provide company phones. They're £150-200 each. Cheaper than a data breach.

### "We don't have time for a 30-minute security meeting"
**Solution:** Do it over lunch. Buy pizza. Make it worth their time.

### "I got stuck on the MFA setup for Xero"
**Solution:** All these systems have help guides. Or just Google "enable 2FA on Xero" - someone's written a guide.

### "A customer asked if we're ISO 27001 certified"
**Solution:** "Not yet, but we're working toward Cyber Essentials and have implemented core security policies." That's an honest, professional answer.

### "One of the engineers refuses to use a password manager"
**Solution:** This is non-negotiable if they access customer data. Frame it as a condition of accessing company systems, like having a driving license to drive the van.
