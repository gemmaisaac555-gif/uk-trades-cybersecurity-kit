## 🎯 Gap Analysis Using This Mapping

**To check if you're CE ready:**

1. Go through each control in this document
2. For each requirement, verify:
   - [ ] Policy/document exists?
   - [ ] Actually implemented?
   - [ ] Evidence available?
   - [ ] Staff trained?

3. Any gaps? Add to action plan:
   - High priority: Required for CE
   - Medium priority: Strongly recommended
   - Low priority: Nice to have

**Most common gaps:**
- MFA not on all critical systems → Enable it
- No documented patch process → Use 90-Day Plan template
- Excessive admin privileges → Create standard user accounts
- Old unsupported software → Upgrade or remove
